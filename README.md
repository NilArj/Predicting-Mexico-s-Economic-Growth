## Project Overview

A data science project focused on predicting Mexico's economic growth utilizing Python and machine learning techniques. The project involves data cleaning, linear regression modeling, and forecasting based on Banco de Mexico's dataset.

## Technologies Used

- Python - The programming language used for data analysis.
- Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn (Sklearn) - For machine learning.
- Linear Regression Model - Used for economic growth prediction.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mexico-economic-growth.git

## Project Problem
The primary objective is to forecast Mexico's economic growth using available data from Banco de Mexico. The dataset was initially cleaned, revealing missing data that needed handling for accurate predictions

## Project Walkthrough
1. Data Cleaning: Identified and handled missing data from the dataset obtained from Banco de Mexico.
2. Handling Null Values: Explored deletion method due to the presence of null values in the dataset.
3. Model Creation: Implemented a linear regression model to predict Mexico's economic growth.
4. Prediction: Forecasted the Gross Domestic Product (PIB) value for 2021.
5. Comparison:
   - Official Government Data: Mexico's economy grew by 4.8% in 2021, according to the Government of Mexico's official page.
   - Prediction Outcome: Utilizing linear regression, the projected growth for Mexico's economy in 2021 stands at 4.74%.

## Project Insights
* Objective: Predict Mexico's Economic Growth

* Official Government Data: Mexico's economy grew by 4.8% in 2021, as per the Government of Mexico's official page.

* Prediction Outcome: Utilizing linear regression, the projected growth for Mexico's economy in 2021 stands at 4.74%.

* Considerations: The dataset used for prediction is limited in size, warranting further tests and additional data for more robust analysis.
